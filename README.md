- GET: https://anchormt-world-staging-at4dfab73a-lz.a.run.app/countries/:countryName -> search countries by name
it is importnat to initiate your API calls on `valueChanges`, and give a debounceTime of 800 milliseconds

## Confirmation Screen Description

this is the last screen that shows all information from `Screen 1` and `Screen 2` and acts as a review screen. In this screen you are requested to show your best in styling and appearance.

## Technical Considerations

- Use RxJS for your internal logic pipelining.
- Use `Angular Material` as a component source for basic components.
  https://material.angular.io/
- Use `Tailwind` as your styling system.
- Use `Reactive Forms` and `Form Builder` for all forms and input work.
- Screens must be responsive and follows all considerations to work on any screen size
